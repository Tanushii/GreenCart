Build me a complete full-stack web application called EcoFinds – Sustainable Second-Hand Marketplace, similar to a lightweight Amazon clone, with the following requirements:

Core Features

Authentication

Email + password signup/login with secure hashing.

Google login (OAuth).

User dashboard to edit username, email, and profile image.

Product Listings (CRUD)

Users can add/edit/delete their own listings.

Each listing has title, description, category (dropdown: Electronics, Clothes, Books, Furniture), price, and one image placeholder.

Product feed page with search + category filter.

Product detail page with image, description, price, category.

Cart + Purchase Flow

Add/remove products from cart.

Cart page showing items in card format with total price.

“Proceed to Payment” → fake payment gateway screen (Card, UPI, COD).

On success → order confirmed and items move to Previous Purchases.

Delivery Tracking

Assign a random delivery date (3–7 days).

Show delivery updates: Ordered → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered.

Status auto-updates every few seconds or based on mock timers.

Previous Purchases

Show purchased items in a separate list with delivery status + date.

UI/UX Requirements

Responsive (desktop + mobile).

Modern clean design: cards, rounded corners, soft shadows.

Navigation bar with Home, My Listings, Cart, Profile, Orders.

Search bar + category filter on the homepage.

Smooth transitions and a professional layout.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (with TailwindCSS for UI, shadcn/ui for components, framer-motion for animations).

Backend: Node.js + Express.

Database: MongoDB (for users, products, orders).

Auth: JWT for email login, Google OAuth for Gmail login.

Extra Notes

Keep it well structured with clear folders (/frontend, /backend).

Include seed data so that some products appear by default.

Delivery tracking can be simulated with timers or mock updates.

Make it easy to run on Replit (all dependencies + setup instructions in README).
